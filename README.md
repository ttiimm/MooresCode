# Moore's Code

An Android app that allows users to message each other with [Morse code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code).

The app uses the camera to send and receive messages typed in by a user. When a message is sent, it's translated into dots-and-dashes, which then are transmitted via the phone's camera flash. When receiving messages, the camera is used to translate those flashes back into dots-and-dashes, and then back into a readable message.
